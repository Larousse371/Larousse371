I'm currently pursuing a BSc (Hons) in Cyber Security and Digital Forensics, where Iâ€™m learning how to protect digital systems, investigate cybercrime, and understand the complex world of digital threats. My studies cover everything from ethical hacking and network security to forensic analysis and incident response.
Iâ€™m passionate about making the digital world safer and more transparent. Whether it's tracing malicious activity, securing critical infrastructure, or uncovering digital evidence, Iâ€™m committed to developing the skills and mindset needed to thrive in this fast-paced field.
This journey is more than just academicâ€”it's about preparing to be a defender of digital integrity and a seeker of truth in the cyber realm.
